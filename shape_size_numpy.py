"""
This section covers ndarray.ndim, ndarray.size, ndarray.shape

ndarray.ndim will tell you the number of axes, or dimensions, of the array.

ndarray.size will tell you the total number of elements of the array. This is the product of the elements of the arrayâ€™s shape.

ndarray.shape will display a tuple of integers that indicate the number of elements stored along each dimension of the array. If, for example, you have a 2-D array with 2 rows and 3 columns, the shape of your array is (2, 3).
