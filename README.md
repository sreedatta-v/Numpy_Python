# NumPy_Python
## Introduction to NumPy 
NumPy (**Numerical Python**) is an open source Python library that’s used in almost every field of science and engineering. It’s the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it’s at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems

The NumPy library contains multidimensional array and matrix data structures.

It provides **`ndarray**,` <i>a homogeneous n-dimensional array object,</i> with methods to efficiently operate on it. NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays.

## Installing NumPy

To install NumPy
`pip install numpy` 

### **How to import NumPy**

`import numpy as np`

We shorten the imported name to `np` for better readability of code using NumPy.
